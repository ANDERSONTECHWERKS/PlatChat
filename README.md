# PlatChat
Chat client for Elite OW players ONLY!

PlatChat scrapes your SR from playoverwatch.com (Your profile must be public!) and connects you to an appropriate channel for your skill rating.

PlatChat is a Java-based chat client built on top of my Transponder networking framework. This project is intended to be a humorous showcase of both the abilities of Transponder, as well as my own.

_PlatChat is being developed alongside Transponder, so please bear with me when that project takes priority_

Channel tiers are:

-Scrub Club:
Anyone with SR 2499 and below

-Plat Chat:
The coveted chat channel of our time. SR 2500-3000 are allowed here.

God-tier: 
Because sometimes you're just too good. SR 3000+ here.
